# Contributing to Distributed Inference

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️
This is just a dummy implementation of Distributed Inference. As per the concepts of Distributed Inference which makes it easier to infer large LLM by loading model in multiple nodes and then inferencing them . In this project, I have  made separate models and stored them in a dict which are actually needed  to be loaded in separate nodes and connected through network. Anyone with sound knowledge of  networking are encouraged to test the validity of this project.

Thank you!!
